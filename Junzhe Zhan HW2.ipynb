When the Prof asked us to use Chatbot to help us learn and finish the homework, I doubted at first. But later, when I followed the instructions and interacted with Chatbots, I found it was much stronger than I thought. It can always provide me with detailed explanations and examples. I gained a lot of coding knowledge and interesting skills when interacting with it. I gradually enjoy the process of interacting with Chatbot.
