    "Objective:\n",
    "We discussed a demonstration of how to evaluate a model's performance using both \"in-sample\" (training set) and \"out-of-sample\" (test set) accuracy across multiple iterations, with the random splits of data (no fixed seed). The goal was to observe the variability in the model's performance due to randomness in data splitting and inherent sampling variability.\n",

    "Key Steps:\n",
    "Data Generation: We created synthetic data (features X and binary target y).\n",
    "Model Training: A Logistic Regression model was trained on the training data and evaluated on both the training and test data.\n",
    "Performance Metrics: We calculated accuracy for both \"in-sample\" (on the training set) and \"out-of-sample\" (on the test set) data.\n",
    "Random Splits: The data was split randomly each time using train_test_split() without setting a fixed random seed, introducing variability in the results.\n",
    "Visualization: We visualized the distribution of accuracies (in-sample vs. out-of-sample) over 100 iterations, showing how performance can fluctuate.\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "The demonstration aimed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Show the variability in model performance due to random splits of the data.\n",
    "Highlight the difference between \"in-sample\" (training) and \"out-of-sample\" (test) performance, helping to assess whether the model is overfitting (high in-sample accuracy, low out-of-sample accuracy) or generalizing well (similar in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy).\n",
    "Provide insight into how stable or unstable the model‚Äôs performance might be in a real-world setting with new data.\n",
    "Outcome:\n",
    "The distribution of accuracies was visualized to highlight how model performance can vary across different random splits.\n",
    "The spread of out-of-sample accuracy helped identify whether the model generalizes well or if performance fluctuates too much due to different data splits.\n",
    "This session helped demonstrate the variability in model performance and the importance of comparing both training and testing accuracies to evaluate model robustness and generalization ability."
